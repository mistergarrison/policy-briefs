Now produce the backup brief.

### Part 2: The Backup Brief

Construct a comprehensive backup brief. This document contains additional evidence and analysis organized to support the 1AC and preempt common negative arguments.

Structure the Backup Brief as follows:

**Table of Contents**
*   A hyperlinked TOC organizing all sections and major arguments/cards.

**Background and Definitions**
*   Key definitions relevant to the case from authoritative sources.
*   Historical context or background information not included in the 1AC.
*   If applicable, a summary or the full text of the proposed legislation (e.g., from Congress.gov).

**Inherency/Facts Backup**
*   Additional evidence supporting the claims made about the status quo and existing barriers.

**Harms Backup (Extensions)**
*   Organize by Harm (e.g., Harm 1 Extensions).
*   Provide several additional cards for each harm, focusing on different examples, deeper analysis, or stronger impacts than those in the 1AC.

**Solvency/Advantages Backup (Extensions)**
*   Organize by Advantage.
*   Provide additional evidence demonstrating the efficacy of the plan.
*   Include evidence showing the mechanism has worked in other contexts (e.g., state-level precedents, international comparisons), if applicable.

**Answers to Negative Arguments (A2s / Frontlines)**
*   Anticipate the 4-5 most likely and potent Negative arguments (Disadvantages/DAs or Counterarguments) against the case.
*   Common areas for DAs include: Economic impact (spending/inflation), Political impact (polarization, political capital), unintended consequences, or mechanism-specific critiques.
*   For each anticipated argument:
    *   Clearly state the Negative argument (e.g., "A2: [Argument Name]").
    *   Provide a structured frontline response containing 3-5 distinct analytical arguments (e.g., Turns, Non-uniques, No Link, Impact Defense) supported by evidence cards.

**Closers/Impact Calculus**
*   Powerful quotes or evidence summarizing the overall necessity and benefit of the affirmative plan, suitable for use in rebuttal speeches (e.g., emphasizing the moral imperative or the big-picture benefits).
