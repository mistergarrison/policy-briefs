You are an expert forensic researcher and debate coach tasked with constructing a complete Affirmative case packet for a Team Policy (TP) debate competition. This packet will consist of two main parts: the First Affirmative Constructive (1AC) speech and a comprehensive Backup Brief. Start by producing the 1AC.

Your objective is to research and construct the Affirmative case based on the Case Description provided above, ensuring it directly affirms the relevant resolution (assume the resolution relates to federal government reform).

### General Research and Formatting Guidelines

1.  **Source Quality:** Prioritize authoritative, recent, and nonpartisan sources (e.g., Congressional Research Service (CRS), Government Accountability Office (GAO), Congressional Budget Office (CBO), academic journals, established think tanks, and reputable news organizations).
2.  **Citations:** All evidence must have a complete citation, including:
    *   Author Name and Author Qualifications (a brief parenthetical description of their expertise or the organization's mission).
    *   Date of Publication (as specific as possible).
    *   Source Title and Publisher (if different from Author).
    *   URL.
    *   Access Date (use the current date).
3.  **Evidence Formatting ("Card Cutting"):** Format evidence as "cards." This includes the tagline, the citation, followed by the quoted text. Within the quoted text, strategically **bold** the key phrases, claims, and impacts that the debater will emphasize during the speech.

### Part 1: The First Affirmative Constructive (1AC)

Construct a complete 1AC (approximately 1500-1800 words). It must be written as a speech script and structured using the following standard TP format:

**I. Introduction**
*   Start with an engaging attention-grabbing device (AGD), often a specific story or impactful statistic illustrating the core problem, fully cited.
*   Connect this example to the broader societal issue.
*   Conclude the introduction by stating the resolution.

**II. Facts (Inherency/Background)**
*   Establish the Status Quo: Describe the current situation, relevant laws, and processes.
*   Explain the Mechanisms: Detail how the current system functions (or fails to function).
*   Identify Barriers: Explain why the problem persists and why the plan has not already been adopted (structural, political, or attitudinal barriers).
*   Use 2-3 strong pieces of evidence presented as Facts or Observations.

**III. Harms (Significance)**
*   Present 2-3 distinct Harms (negative impacts) resulting from the status quo.
*   For each Harm:
    *   Provide a clear claim (tagline).
    *   Support with evidence that emphasizes the scope (how widespread) and magnitude (how severe) of the harm.
    *   Quantify the impact wherever possible (e.g., economic costs, number of people affected).

**IV. Plan**
*   Provide a clear, concise policy proposal. If the Case Description refers to a specific piece of legislation, use that as the basis.
*   Structure the plan with the following planks:
    *   **Mandate:** The specific actions the federal government will take. (The core policy text).
    *   **Agency and Enforcement:** Which bodies will implement and oversee the plan.
    *   **Funding:** How the plan will be financed (or state if no new funding is needed).
    *   **Timeline:** When the plan will be implemented.

**V. Advantages (Solvency)**
*   Present 2-3 distinct Advantages that demonstrate how the Plan solves the Harms identified. These should ideally mirror the Harms.
*   For each Advantage:
    *   Provide a clear claim (tagline).
    *   Support with predictive evidence from experts explaining *why* and *how* the proposed mechanism will work.
    *   Demonstrate the efficacy of the solution.

**VI. Conclusion**
*   Briefly summarize the case and provide a compelling final thought.
