*   Provide historical context, including the frequency of the problem and past attempts at reform.

**II. Significance and Harms (The Problem)**

*   Identify historical precedents or analogous models (e.g., state-level or international examples) where similar policies have been implemented, detailing the outcomes and lessons learned.
*   Articulate distinct advantages gained by adopting the plan beyond solving the immediate harms.

**V. Negative Anticipation and Preemption**
*   Identify the strongest and most likely arguments (Disadvantages) against the proposed plan, including unintended consequences, opportunity costs, and impacts on existing incentives.
